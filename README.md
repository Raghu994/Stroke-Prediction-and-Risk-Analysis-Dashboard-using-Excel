# Stroke-Prediction-and-Risk-Analysis-Dashboard-using-Excel


##  Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of a healthcare dataset(taken from kaggle:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) containing 5,110 patient records. The goal was to identify key risk factors associated with strokes and visualize these insights using an interactive **Microsoft Excel Dashboard**.

This project demonstrates the entire data analysis workflow:
1.  **Data Cleaning** (Handling missing BMI values, standardizing categorical data).
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (Finding trends in age, glucose levels, and work types).
3.  **Visualization** (Creating Treemaps, Scatter Plots, and interactive Pivot Charts).


##  Key Insights Discovered
* **Age Correlation:** A strong positive correlation was observed between **Age** and **Average Glucose Levels**, indicating higher glucose levels in older demographics.
* **Stroke Risk:** The calculated probability of stroke is roughly equal between males (**~5.1%**) and females (**~4.7%**) in this dataset.
* **Lifestyle Impact:** Visualized patient distribution across different work sectors (Private, Self-Employed, Govt) and residence types (Urban vs. Rural).
* **BMI Analysis:** Identified outliers in BMI vs. Age using scatter plots.

## Tools & Techniques Used
* **Microsoft Excel 2019/365**
    * **Data Cleaning:** Find & Replace, Filtering, Formatting Data Types.
    * **Pivot Tables:** Grouping data (Age buckets), Aggregations (Average, Count).
    * **Advanced Charts:** Treemaps, Histograms, Scatter Plots, Sparklines.
    * **Dashboarding:** Interactive Slicers for Gender and Smoking Status filtering.

## 📂 Dataset features
* **Features:** ID, Gender, Age, Hypertension, Heart Disease, Ever Married, Work Type, Residence Type, Avg Glucose Level, BMI, Smoking Status, Stroke.
